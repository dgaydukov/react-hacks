# react-hacks

This project includes some interesting and the same time hard problems i have encountered developing react apps

* auto-build
* react-redirect-strategy
* react-virtualization
* render-optimization-&-event-memoization-with-weakmaps

## Really Big

There are others problems, i solved, but they were to big to be part on one repository, so i created a repo for each of them

* [react-partial-application](https://github.com/dgaydukov/react-partial-application)
* [cross-domain-iframe-integration](https://github.com/dgaydukov/cross-domain-iframe-integration)
