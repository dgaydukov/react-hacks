# react-hacks

This project includes some interesting and the same time hard problems i have encountered developing react apps

* [auto-build](https://github.com/dgaydukov/react-hacks/blob/master/md/auto-build.md)
* [event-memoization](https://github.com/dgaydukov/react-hacks/blob/master/md/event-memoization.md) - render-optimization-&-event-memoization-with-weakmaps
* [react-virtualization](https://github.com/dgaydukov/react-hacks/blob/master/md/react-virtualization.md)
* [redirect-strategy](https://github.com/dgaydukov/react-hacks/blob/master/md/redirect-strategy.md)

## Really Big

There are others problems, i solved, but they were to big to be part on one repository, so i created a repo for each of them

* [react-partial-application](https://github.com/dgaydukov/react-partial-application)
* [cross-domain-iframe-integration](https://github.com/dgaydukov/cross-domain-iframe-integration)
