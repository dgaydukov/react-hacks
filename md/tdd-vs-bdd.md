# TDD vs BDD

Tests is a must-have. But what kind of tests you should write. Basically there are 2 main methodologies
* TDD - test driven development
* BDD - behavior driven development

Both are about writing tests first. So in this they are similar. The question is what kind of tests.
In case of tdd - it's all about simple unit testing.
In case of bdd - it's all about complex specification & integration tests.
